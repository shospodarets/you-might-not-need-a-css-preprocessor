# You might not need a CSS preprocessor slides

Having native CSS variables, which work in all modern browsers, also mixins and nesting, we can consider switching from preprocessors to native CSS and look for a path to migration.


In the presentation, there is a description of the modern abilities of CSS, which specs are in progress, demos how this already works in browsers and how to use polyfills to make these CSS goodness work everywhere.


You will know: 
1) That mostly everything you need in preprocessors currently is available in pure CSS 
2) How to make it work cross-browser 
3) The real examples of already migrated sites
